    "text": "Learning Meaningful Representations of Scientific Data\nApplications of AI analyses to tackle science problems are often limited by the scarcity of high-quality curated datasets for exploration. Frequently, real-world datasets are incomplete, contain inaccurate observations, and come at variable sample resolutions. Moreover, even in situations where homogeneous data are aplenty, data labeling for supervised learning presents a laborious time investment. Here is where self-supervised learning comes to the rescue.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables a model to automatically generate labels for unstructured data, thereby eliminating the need for large pre-labeled datasets. Building upon a small set of accurate human-annotated data, SSL algorithms learn latent representations of the input data through an iterative procedure. The labels generated in the first iteration are treated as the ground truth in the second iteration and so on.\nGenerative SSL tries to predict masked portions of raw data (text, images, audio, or video) from unmasked segments by learning embeddings of their underlying shared information. On the other hand, contrastive SSL techniques involves defining positive and negative versions of an “anchor” (say, the concept of what a dog looks like). Using a notion of distance in feature space, the algorithm then looks to align positives (e.g., images of dogs) to the anchor while simultaneously repelling the negatives (e.g., images of cats).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources on Self-supervised Learning\n\n\n\n\nA Beginner’s Guide to Self-supervised Learning by Rohit Kundu\nFDL 2022 Live Showcase video: Self-Supervised Learning for Change Detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar Data"

For example, consider wind velocity in flight dynamics or magnetic field strength in tokamak nuclear fusion reactors. Conventional neural networks assume a fixed data discretization and are hence, inflexible at handling raw data sampled at varying resolutions. Neural operators, in contrast, learn mappings between function spaces of the input and output data to allow discretization-invariant predictions. Once these operators are trained, they can be evaluated at any data resolution without a need for model retraining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources on Neural Operators and Their Applications\n\n\n\n\nNeural Operators in PyTorch\nVideo: Anima Anandkumar, Neural operator: A new paradigm for learning PDEs.\nFDL 2021 Live Showcase video: Digital Twin Earth: Coasts.\nKovachki, N., Li, Z., et al., “Neural Operator: Learning Maps Between Function Spaces”, JMLR, 4(89):1−97, 2023."

    "text": "Reinforcement Learning for Navigating Large Hypothesis Spaces\nThe prospect of sampling through all possible competing hypotheses agreeable with the data can seem intimidating at first. Reinforcement learning (RL) instead recasts the problem as an endeavor to find a single good solution that fits the data.\nRL can be thought of as the science and framework of learning to make decisions through interaction. Core concepts of the RL formalism include:\n\nAn environment (governs the dynamics of the problem)\nA scalar reward signal (specifies the goal)\nAn agent comprising necessarily of an agent state and a policy (mapping from agent states to actions).\n\nAt every time step \\(t\\), the agent makes an observation of the environment and perceives a reward (or a penalty). Based on the instantaneous reward, the agent estimates its rewards into the future and decides its next action based on an internal policy. By defining AI policies that maximize rewards in the direction of increased fit between model parameters and the data, RL can drive systems towards optimal solutions. Further, by introducing inductive biases in AI policies, one can incorporate prior scientific knowledge to steer searches towards realistically feasible solutions, thereby enhancing model trust and interpretability.\nNote that the AI policy must allow adequate exploration of the search parameter space so as to not get trapped in a local optimum during the quest to globally maximize the cumulative reward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources on Reinforcement Learning\n\n\n\n\nGoogle DeepMind 2021 Reinforcement Learning Course, University College London\nCoursera: Reinforcement Learning Specialization"
