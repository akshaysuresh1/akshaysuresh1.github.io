### Data Scientist | AI Researcher 
---

Hi there! I am Akshay Suresh. I am a freelance data scientist building artificial intelligence (AI) tools for positive climate impact. In the past, I engineered software pipelines to automate searches of terabytes of astronomy data for exotic events, including plausible signs of intelligent life beyond the Earth.

**Major project highlights:**

* A LiDAR-based evaluation of rooftop solar feasibility, revealing that 53% of homeowners in DeLand, Florida, can save over $1000 annually by transitioning to solar-powered households. 
* Developing a scalable tool for near real-time forecast of earthquakes induced from underground carbon storage, thereby enabling proactive measures to minimize the seismic hazard.
* Designing a novel open-source software to detect repeating radar-like transmissions from potential technologically advanced worlds residing in the Milky Way.

Check out my [About](about.qmd) and [Projects](projects.qmd) pages to learn about my educational background and workplace experiences. I also maintain a [blog](blog.qmd), where I occasionally post about readings that catch my interest. Outside of work, I enjoy following cricket, playing board games, and exploring natural wonders.
