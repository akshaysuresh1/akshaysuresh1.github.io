### Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer 
---

I leverage data and artificial intelligence (AI) for positive human and climate impact. In the past, I engineered software pipelines to automate searches of radio astronomy data for time-variable events, including plausible signs of intelligent life beyond the Earth.

**Major project highlights:**

* Orchestrated test-driven software development of a segmentation model to detect Amazon rainforest cover in satellite imagery with a 97% true positive rate. 

* Evaluated rooftop solar viability through LiDAR data analysis, demonstrating that 53% of homeowners in DeLand, Florida, could save over $1,000 annually by transitioning to solar-powered households.

* Developed a scalable tool for near real-time forecast of earthquakes induced from underground carbon storage, thereby enabling proactive measures to minimize the seismic hazard.

Check out my [About](about.qmd) and [Projects](projects.qmd) pages to learn about my educational background and workplace experiences. I  maintain a [blog](blog.qmd), where I occasionally post about readings that catch my interest. Outside of work, I enjoy following cricket, playing board games, and going out on nature walks.
