title: "Mapping Historical Crop Yields in India"

description: Maps offer an intuitive means to represent the spatial distribution of data, helping users understand the geographic context and relationships between different locations. With human-induced climate change a reality, understanding evolutionary patterns in nationwide crop yields is essential to ensure food sustainability. India is the world's second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, and cotton. Using Python, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize district-level yield distributions of these crops across India between 1990 &ndash; 2017. This dashboard (presently offline) was hosted on the Amazon Web Services EC2 server.

This project was completed as part of the Erd&ouml;s Institute Data Visualization Mini-course, Spring&nbsp;2023.

## Applications features
I included a live walkthrough of the dashboard in my [2-minutes project presentation video](https://youtu.be/x6f5EpSTQ7c), showcasing the following interactive features.

- User option to zoom in/out of the map
- Cursor hover displaying values of the plotted quantity for the selected district.
- Dropdown menu for selecting the quantity to visualize. Options include `yield (kg/ha)`, `harvested area (1000 ha)`, and `production (1000 tonnes)`.
- Dropdown menu for selecting a crop of interest. Here, the available menu options are `Rice`, `Wheat`, `Sugarcane`, `Cotton`, and `Groundnut`.
- Slider to select a year between 1990 and 2017.
