description: Carbon sequestration involves capturing CO$_2$ from factories or directly from the air and storing it underground as a supercritical fluid. Geologic carbon capture and storage is required to meet global carbon neutrality goals, with over 30&nbsp;gigatons of CO$_2$ storage needed in the US alone by 2050. However, subsurface carbon storage comes with a catch. One may artificially induce earthquakes by injecting CO$_2$ (or any fluid) underground. Seismicity forecasts help safeguard public trust in carbon sequestration plants by informing the pace of fluid injections to minimize the associated seismic hazard. Here, leveraging numerical computing best practices and state-of-the-art time series analysis tools, we built an accessible, streamlined version of an existing physics-based earthquake forecasting model to enable near real-time accurate seismicity forecasts for safe commercial sequestration operations.

## The Challenge
Achieving the US goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 will require the storage of over 30&nbsp;gigatons of CO$_2$ across 30,000 carbon sequestration plants in the country. However, carbon capture and storage, like any other underground fluid injection process, carries the risk of artificially inducing earthquakes. A noteworthy historical example in this regard is Oklahoma, a US state which saw sparse seismic activity during 1974 &ndash; 2008. Continued underground wastewater disposal since then has sparked a significant surge in seismic activity across Oklahoma.

Forecasts of induced seismicity are essential to permit bulk underground storage of CO$_2$ with minimal seismic hazard. However, existing models of induced seismicity leave much to be desired. Some forecasting models, as evident from the blue, pink, and gray curves in the below figure, are highly inaccurate. Among the more accurate formulations, the physics-based Coupled Coulomb Rate-State (CRS) models are highly site-specific, prohibitively slow, and extremely resource-intensive &mdash; requiring supercomputers to train. Further, operation of these models demands significant domain knowledge at the level of a seismology PhD candidate, which limits their utility to a general operator at a CO$_2$ sequestration plant.

Altogether, equipping CRS models with enhanced speed and accessibility can go a long way towards enabling rapid, accurate induced seismicity forecasts for safe carbon sequestration.

## Coupled Coulomb Rate-State (CRS) model

**What does a CRS model take as input?**
Spatiotemporal grids of subsurface fluid pore pressure and pressurization rate. These grids are computed using knowledge of the spatial distribution of injection wells and time series of fluid injection volume rates at each well.

**What does a CRS model output?**
Time series of cumulative earthquake counts in a specific locality or region of space. Precise locations of earthquake epicenters are not predicted.

## ML-ready data products on Zenodo

| Location (USA) | Area covered by earthquakes | No. of injection wells | Assumed no. of causally connected earthquake clusters | Cause of induced earthquakes |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|:------:|
| Decatur, Illinois | 4 km $\times$ 5 km | 1 | 1 | Subsurface CO$_2$ injection |
| Cushing, Oklahoma | 4 km $\times$ 6 km | 1 | 1 | Underground wastewater disposal |
| Kansas | 60 km $\times$ 45 km | 102 | 8 | Underground wastewater disposal |

For every cluster in each location, we generated separate pressure and earthquake catalogs.

**Pressure catalog:** epoch, fluid pore pressure at seismicity centroid, pressurization rate at seismicity centroud

**Seismic catalog:** epoch, northing, easting, depth, latitude, longitude, magnitude

We encourage interested readers to consult our technical report (see note near the top of this page) for references to data sources behind every catalog.

## The Road to a Streamlined CRS Model

1. **Speed gain:** We successfully lowered model training time from a whopping 22 hours to a mere 3 minutes on a tablet through the following improvements.

- Implemented code vectorization in PyTorch for model speedup. Original CRS model was written in Python.
- Reduced search space dimensionality by grouping redundant parameters in equations governing the CRS model. 
- Introduced the Adam optimizer from ML to navigate a smooth multi-dimensional loss landscape for model training. Original model used a slow grid search for parameter optimization.

2. **Accuracy enhancement:** Integrated ML techniques (LSTM, SCINet) with our physics-based CRS model to build reliable forecasts across diverse horizon lengths.

The vertical dotted lines in both panels demarcate the boundaries between our training data to the left and our validation data to the right.
:::

3. **Accessibility upgrade:** Users of our streamlined CRS implementation now only need to understand basic signal processing, some elementary statistics, and the concept of model fitting. Domain knowledge in seismology is no longer a prerequisite for model operation.

<u>**Quantifying model gains:**</u>
$$
\frac{{\rm No. \ of \ CO_2 \ sequestration \ sites} \times {\rm Model \  training \ time} }{\rm Time \ between \ runs} = {\rm No. \ of \ operators \ required}
$$

Original CRS model (not scalable):
$$
\frac{{\rm 30,000 } \times {\rm 1 \ day} }{\rm 5 \ days } = {\rm 6000 \ analysts \ from \ a \ pool \ of \ 10,000 \ seismiology \ PhDs}
$$
This would require restructuring the academic seismological community to do repetitive tasks and stop working on other pressing issues. Also, achieving safety with forecasts would be expensive.

Streamlined CRS model:
$$
\frac{{\rm 30,000 } \times {\rm (1/10) \ day} }{\rm 5 \ days } = {\rm 600 \ individuals\ with \ basic \ computing \ skills \ (feasible)}
$$

**Note:**

1. In the above calculations, we asummed a gap of 5 days between successive model runs.
2. Though our streamlined CRS implementation comes with a training time of only 3 minutes, we assumed a generous modeling time of about 2&nbsp;hours to account for any hardware setup that may be needed before runs.
